# FullStackOpen Chapter Projects and Exercises
I recently discovered the excellent open source course on modern web development at [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/) and decided to start working on it! I've been wanting to take a deeper dive into React as well as some NodeJS backend offerings. This course fits that need perfectly!

This is a repo containing all of the code written while following along with the chapters in the book, as well as the code written for the exercises at the end of each section.
